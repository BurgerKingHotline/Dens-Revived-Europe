 TOM_royal_government_crisis.1.title: "Protests against Royal Government"
 TOM_royal_government_crisis.1.desc: "Despite the pressure by the King, the largest protests against the royal government since its establishment have been held all across the country. These protests are diverse with supporters from the fascistic English National Party to the revolutionary Communist Party to the parliamentarians of the centrist parties and all those inbetween. Direct rule from the King was ushered in to try and quell the politcal instability in this time of crisis but has only ushered in greater instability than before."
