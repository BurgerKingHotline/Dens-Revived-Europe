 ONI_events.1.d:0 "Some call it a freak disaster, an asteroid or some sort of climate change aftereffect. Some are calling it an act of God. Whatever the case, this is not the same Europe.\n\nData is limited, but it seems that our new nation has made it out in one piece, but not perfectly. The Icelandic people are in civil unrest, and Faroe Island is under full occupation. Our northern lands are not responding to any signals, and it seems like civilization has broken down up there. From preliminary reports the nation of Sweden has collapsed, along with our other Scandanavian brothers. This truly is a dark time.\n\nBut this will not stop us. We have been blessed to be alive in this world, and we shall not stop our course because of this catastrophe. The old Europe is dead, but a new one is just being born. And I hope we will be the ones to bring this world to prosperity.\n\nMay God be with us, and may God be with Norway-Iceland!"

 ONI_events.2.t:0 "A Tale from Iceland"
 ONI_events.2.d:0 "The new radar tower had just been completed, and the head engineer sat down on his seat with a sigh. The freezing island of Iceland seemed like it had survived normal enough through the chaos. The dock at Reykjavík was in surprisingly good condition, and there were no hitches driving to base or installing the new radar. Hell, even the weather seemed cherry, with no signs of clouds or even a heavy wind to toss our hats away. The engineer chuckled. \n\nFrom a perfectly industrial standard, Iceland had made it through well. But there was still something off. The Icelandic people seemed off, somehow. Not from their attitude, not from their work ethic, those were all to be expected. But it was the tone as they spoke, the slight fear in their eyes as they did their daily duties, disturbed him. It wasn’t even directed at the envoy, as some of the other workers theorized. The people of Reykjavík had greeted them with joy, but not without a tinge of something else. It could be seen as they collected fruit in a basket, as they played with their children, as they sat in their own homes. And every time we would ask them, try and inquire about what happened, we only got a short response from them:\n\n'The storm has awoken.'\n\nThe head engineer was awoken from his thoughts by the calling of another worker, calling for the final cleanup before they returned to Oslo. Maybe this is all some fantasy, he thought, as he picked up his hard hat from the ground, the paint staining the frozen dirt."

 ONI_events.3.t:0 "What Once was Sweden"
 ONI_events.3.d:0 "One of our new militia units was raised from the mountain town of Brekken, on the cusp of our government's current mandate. They were an impressive bunch, all performing well during our preliminary trials. But this is not why I am mentioning this group, Prime Minister. What is much more interesting to me is their stories from home. \n\nAs you already know, we have lost contact with most of our neighbors, the most pressing of which is from Sweden. It was a surprise to me, especially hearing of the news, but that is not new news. What is important is that this Brekken militia has supposedly traversed across the border into the Swedish wilds, and their stories are nothing short of curious. The militia described a near-total collapse of society, with the local population seemingly gone mad. It seems that the people of Sweden have regressed to a pre-industrial society. What confuses me from this story the most is how this insanity seemingly stopped at our national border, with the militia commenting on a certain town, “Funäsdalen”, the most. I know you have visited this town, and we both know these people would never regress like this.\n\nI understand that the government's scope at the current moment is very limited. But I believe it would be imperative for us to investigate this peculiar activity more. Maybe we can figure out what made Sweden mad.\n\n     -Director of Foreign Relations"

 ONI_events.4.t:0 "The First Voyage"
 ONI_events.4.d:0 "Crowds cheered as the first diplomatic voyage set off from Oslo. A fleet of over "The whole of Oslo seemed to cheer as the first diplomatic voyage set off from the city. Comprising a mix of civilian shipping boats and steamers, it only had one mission - to find out what the rest of Europe feared during the chaos. At the front of the pack lay a mighty Antediluvian-class battleship, repaired and gleaming, the only of its kind to survive the great change. On it lay the head admiral, ready and determined to find out what lay beyond the ocean.\n\nThe Admiral didn’t know what to expect from this voyage. In a perfect world he would arrive in a normal state, full of normal people in a normal world. But after hearing the whispers and reports of what has happened across the border, he cannot be too sure. The lack of any outside communication nagged him, pressing doubt and even fear. But that did not concern him, he had direct orders from the Prime minister to push forward across the waves. In his hand still lay the printed initiative, pointing him towards an unknown coast.\n\nPulling the paper out of his pocket, he read the neatly inked text once more:"

 ONI_events.5.t:0 "A Foriegn Visitor"
 ONI_events.5.d:0 "At any other time, this would be seen as a normal occurrence, unusual at best. A passenger ship full to the brim with people, signaling to dock at with whatever options they had on board. But these are not normal times. I can say with honor that the workers and officials at the Terminal Reykjavik handled this situation all according to regulation, even in these trying times. We successfully signaled the ship down, and sent forward two craft to go investigate this mystery ship. What they returned with was unexpected.\n\nAccording to their report, the ship (called the USR Gearhart) is full of immigrants from the United States of America. But the people on board didn’t refer to themselves as Americans, interestingly, but as “Oregonians”. According to the migrants, the United States has collapsed, and Oregon is currently embattled with a civil war unlike no other. They said that they were only the first ship able to make it across the sea, and that others are searching for a safe civilisation to seek refuge in.\n\nI am asking simply to let these immigrants in, and start an immigration program from the collapsed USA. I hope you can respond in haste, as it is getting dark out, and these people can only survive on the Gearhart for so long."
