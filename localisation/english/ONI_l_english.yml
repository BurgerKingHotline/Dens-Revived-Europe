 ONI_events.0.d:0 "test lmao"
 ONI_events.0.a:0 "This activates BOP"

 ONI_events.1.t:0 "Survival"
 ONI_events.1.d:0 "Some call it a freak disaster, an asteroid or some sort of climate change aftereffect. Some are calling it an act of God. Whatever the case, this is not the same Europe.\n\nData is limited, but it seems that our new nation has made it out in one piece, but not perfectly. The Icelandic people are in civil unrest, and Faroe Island is under full occupation. Our northern lands are not responding to any signals, and it seems like civilization has broken down up there. From preliminary reports the nation of Sweden has collapsed, along with our other Scandanavian brothers. This truly is a dark time.\n\nBut this will not stop us. We have been blessed to be alive in this world, and we shall not stop our course because of this catastrophe. The old Europe is dead, but a new one is just being born. And I hope we will be the ones to bring this world to prosperity.\n\nMay God be with us, and may God be with Norway-Iceland!"
 ONI_events.1.a:0 "Hurrah!"

#IDEAS
 ONI_provisional_govt:0 "Provisional Government"
 ONI_provisional_govt_desc:0 "To keep the nation from total anarchy, the government has taken executative action, avoiding catastrophe but severely limiting its adaptability for the near future, much to the dismay of the public."
 ONI_unification_for_survival:0 "Unification for Survival"
 ONI_unification_for_survival_desc:0 "The merging of the Icelandic and Norwegian governments was not one of passion, but of neccesity. Neither nation was prepared for this, and the people still do not fully support this action."
 ONI_broken_infra:0 "Broken Infrastructure"
 ONI_broken_infra_desc:0 "After the disaster, our infrastructure was left in tatters, especially in the northern reaches. Much work will have to be done to repair this damage."
